    """
    Computes the Intersection over Union (IoU) for a batch of 3D axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABB).

    This function calculates the IoU for two batches of axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs), where IoU is
    defined as the volume of the intersection of two bounding boxes divided by the volume of their union.
    The bounding boxes are provided as tensors representing the minimum and maximum coordinates of each
    box in a batch-wise fashion. Both input tensors must have the same shape and correspond to pairs
    of bounding boxes.

    Args:
        batch_boxes_1_bound (torch.Tensor): A tensor of shape (B, 2, D), where B is the batch size and
            D is the dimensionality of the bounding boxes. Represents the minimum and maximum coordinates
            of the first set of bounding boxes.
        batch_boxes_2_bound (torch.Tensor): A tensor of shape (B, 2, D), where B is the batch size and
            D is the dimensionality of the bounding boxes. Represents the minimum and maximum coordinates
            of the second set of bounding boxes.

    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: A 1D tensor of shape (B,), where each element represents the IoU value for the
        corresponding pair of bounding boxes in the input batches.
